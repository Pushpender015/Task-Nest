# Task Nest

Task Nest is a simple and efficient Todo management application built with React, Context API, and Local Storage. It allows users to manage tasks (Todos), including adding, editing, marking as completed, and deleting them. The app uses the Context API to manage the state and persists the tasks in the browser's local storage, so the data remains even after a page refresh.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a description.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks.
- Persistent data with Local Storage â€“ your tasks are saved even after refreshing the page.
- Responsive and clean UI design built using Tailwind CSS.
